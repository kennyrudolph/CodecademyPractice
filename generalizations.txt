Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers.

Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:
- git init creates a new Git repository.
- git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area.
- git add <filename> adds files from the working directory to the staging area.
- git add . adds all files from the working directory to the staging area.
- git commit -m <message> permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository.

GitHub is a service for hosting remote repositories on the web.
- git remote add origin <url> specifies the remote repository using Git
- git push -u origin master pushes the changes to the master branch on the remote repository, linking the local repository to the remote repository.
- git push origin master pushes the changes to the master branch on the remote repository, given that the local repository and the remote repository are already linked.
